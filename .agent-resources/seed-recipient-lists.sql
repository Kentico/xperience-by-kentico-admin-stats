-- Seeds recipient list subscriptions for visual testing of a recipient lists report.
-- LOCAL DEV DB ONLY (DancingGoat example). Never run on a real project.
--
-- Mirrors the product (31.9):
--   OM_ContactGroupMember                       -> current membership only (no dates), type 0 = contact
--   EmailLibrary_EmailSubscriptionConfirmation  -> event history: Confirm = approved row, Revoke = unapproved row
--   Unsubscribe keeps the member row. Double opt-in: member row first, approved row after the link click.
--   EmailLibrary_EmailBounce                    -> per email address: hard bounce, or soft bounce count (limit 5 by default)
--
-- Lists:
--   DancingGoat.RecipientList (existing, matched by code name; skipped when missing)
--   SeedProductNews "Product news (seed)" (created once with a fixed GUID, plus its RecipientListSettings row)
--
-- Per contact with an email and list (deterministic, CHECKSUM of an MD5 of the contact GUID; plain CHECKSUM(guid, 'a') and (guid, 'b') are correlated):
--   ~40% (DancingGoat list) / ~20% (seed list) subscribe 0-20 days after the contact was created: member row + approved row
--   ~5% have a member row only (not confirmed, pending double opt-in)
--   ~15% of subscribers unsubscribe 1-40 days later (unapproved row, member row kept); ~25% of those subscribe again 5-30 days after that
--   Events after now are dropped.
-- Bounces: ~3% of subscribed contacts get an EmailBounce row: hard bounce, soft bounce at the limit (5), or soft bounce below it (2).
--
-- Real data is never changed: contact + list pairs that already have a member row or a confirmation row that is not seeded are skipped,
-- and bounce rows are added only for emails without one.
--
-- Re-run: seeded confirmation rows have deterministic GUIDs (MD5 of 'SEED-RL|contact|list|step') and are deleted first.
-- Member rows (no GUID) are deleted only for planned contact + list pairs without any non-seeded confirmation row,
-- and bounce rows only for the planned bounce emails.
--
-- Run (Git Bash):
