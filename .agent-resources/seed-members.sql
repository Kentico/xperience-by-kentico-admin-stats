-- Seeds members for visual testing of a member registrations report.
-- LOCAL DEV DB ONLY (DancingGoat example). Never run on a real project.
--
-- Every seeded member is an existing contact (sites with membership usually require tracking consent):
--   member email / name = contact email, first + last name are not stored on CMS_Member.
--   * Contacts that already have 'memberregistration' activities: member created at their first one.
--   * ~30% of other contacts with an email: member created 0-72 hours after the contact,
--     plus one new 'memberregistration' activity at that time (like the product logs on registration).
-- ~8% of members are disabled, ~12% are external (external sign-in). Passwords are not set, so seeded
-- members cannot sign in. Emails that already belong to a member are skipped. Members created after now are dropped.
-- OM_ProfileReference is left empty: profiles are a preview feature, enabled in code, not enabled in DancingGoat.
--
-- Seeded members get deterministic GUIDs (MD5 of 'SEED-MEMBER|contact'); seeded activities have
-- ActivityValue 'SEED-MEMBER'. Re-running deletes both (and role memberships / customer links of seeded members) first.
--
-- Run (Git Bash):
--   MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker exec -i mssql2022 /opt/mssql-tools18/bin/sqlcmd -C -S localhost -U sa -P '<password>' \
