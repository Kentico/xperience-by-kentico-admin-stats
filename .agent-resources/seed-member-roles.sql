-- Seeds member roles for visual testing of the member registrations report ("Members by role" tile).
-- LOCAL DEV DB ONLY (DancingGoat example). Never run on a real project.
-- Run AFTER seed-members.sql (re-running seed-members.sql removes the role memberships of seeded members; run this again then).
--
-- Creates 4 roles (code names prefixed 'Seed') and puts ~60% of the seeded members in 1-2 roles, uneven sizes:
--   Premium ~30%, Partners ~15%, Newsletter only ~10% (+ ~1/3 of Premium also get it), Beta testers: a few Partners.
-- Seeded members are those with the deterministic GUIDs of seed-members.sql (MD5 of 'SEED-MEMBER|contact').
-- Re-running deletes the 'Seed%' roles (with their memberships and content item role links) first.
--
-- Run (Git Bash):
--   MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker exec -i mssql2022 /opt/mssql-tools18/bin/sqlcmd -C -S localhost -U sa -P '<password>' \
--     -d xperience-by-kentico-simple-stats -b < .agent-resources/seed-member-roles.sql
