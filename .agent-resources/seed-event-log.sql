-- Seeds CMS_EventLog with past events for visual testing of the "Event log" report.
-- LOCAL DEV DB ONLY (DancingGoat example). Never run on a real project.
--
-- Copies existing (not seeded) events to the 120 days before the latest real event day:
-- uneven daily volume, a few days with no events, error spikes on some days,
-- system events (no user) and user events kept as in the copied rows.
-- Seeded rows are marked with EventMachineName = 'simple-stats-seed', so re-running replaces them.
-- Stays well under the "Event log size" setting (CMSLogSize), so the product does not trim the log.
--
-- Run (Git Bash):
--   MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker exec -i mssql2022 /opt/mssql-tools18/bin/sqlcmd -C -S localhost -U sa -P '<password>' \
--     -d xperience-by-kentico-simple-stats < .agent-resources/seed-event-log.sql
